# Learn-Swift

A playground for learning Swift

## Notes

- to run a file in terminal: "swift file_name.swift"
- to compile a file in swift: "swiftc file_name.swift"
- Swift is case sensitive. "B" != "b"
- When combining logical operators ("&&", "||"), "&&" takes priority, unless parenthesis are used in which case that takes precedence.
